Q 1) Exercise programs on basic control structures & loops.
a)# Program to check if a number is even or odd
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is even.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is odd.")

b)# Program to print decimal equivalents of 1/2, 1/3, 1/4,... 1/10
for i in range(2, 11):
    print(f"1/{i} = {1/i}")

c)# Program to reverse a number
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(int(str(number)[::-1]))

d)# Program to find the largest number among 3 numbers
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))

largest = max(num1, num2, num3)

print(f"The largest number is: {largest}")

e)# Program to print countdown from a number to zero
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

while number >= 0:
    print(number)
    number -= 1

Q 2) Exercise programs on operators & I\O operations.

a)# Program to take 2 numbers from command line arguments and print their sum
import sys

# Ensure there are exactly two arguments
if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print("Please provide exactly two numbers.")
else:
    # Convert the arguments to floats and calculate their sum
    num1 = float(sys.argv[1])
    num2 = float(sys.argv[2])
    print(num1 + num2)


b) # Program demonstrating the usage of various operators in Python
a = 10
b = 3

# Arithmetic operators
print(f"Addition: {a + b}")
print(f"Subtraction: {a - b}")
print(f"Multiplication: {a * b}")
print(f"Division: {a / b}")
print(f"Modulus: {a % b}")
print(f"Exponentiation: {a ** b}")
print(f"Floor Division: {a // b}")

# Comparison operators
print(f"a > b: {a > b}")
print(f"a < b: {a < b}")
print(f"a == b: {a == b}")
print(f"a != b: {a != b}")

# Logical operators
print(f"a > 5 and b < 5: {a > 5 and b < 5}")
print(f"a > 5 or b < 5: {a > 5 or b < 5}")
print(f"not(a > 5): {not(a > 5)}")

# Assignment operators
c = 5
c += 3
print(f"c after c += 3: {c}")

b)# Program to check voting eligibility based on age
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")

c)# Program to check voting eligibility based on age
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")

d)# Program to check if a year is a leap year
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
